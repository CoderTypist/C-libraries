# C-libraries
Many of these files call functions from each other. 
For detailed descriptions of all of the functions, refer to the .h files.

I made most of these my sophmore year, so the code is kind of ugly. However, it still works. 

cjbbyte.h:
    Functions for printing the bits contained within bytes.
    
cjbdebug.h:
    Macros to aid with debugging.
    
cjbfile.h:
    Helpful functions for reading and writing to files.
    
cjbqueue.h:
    Queue implemented by mallocing continuous memory. I have implemented a linked list with an extensive set of functions in another repository.
    
cjbstring.h:
    Helpful functions for dealing with Strings.
    
cjbUTF8.h:
    Functions for showing the true nature of UTF8 encoded files.
    
Fun fact:
    cjb are my initials. That is why all the file names start with cjb.
